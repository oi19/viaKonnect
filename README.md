# React Native expo + Typescript

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: Install Expo CLI globally using npm or yarn:
  

```shell script
# using npm
npm install -g expo-cli
```

  OR
  
```shell script
# using yarn
yarn global add expo-cli
```
- Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```shell script
git clone <https://github.com/oi19/Noaat.git>
```
   
- Navigate to Project Directory: Change your current directory to the project folder:
   
```shell script
cd Noaat
```
   
- Install Dependencies: Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:

```shell script
# using npm
npm install 
```

  OR
  
```shell script
# using yarn
yarn install
```
### Expo Go App

Install Expo Go: Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US).


# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
## Step 2: Start your Application

1. Install the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).
2. After installing Expo Go, open the app.
3. Use your device's camera to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal when you run your Expo project. **_Make sure you're using Expo Go by pressing 's' when prompted._**
4. Expo Go will load your project, and you'll be able to interact with it on your mobile device.

Make sure your mobile device is connected to the same network as your development environment. This allows Expo Go to communicate with the Expo CLI running on your computer and load your app.


## Congratulations! :tada:
